## Amazon Transcribe & Email Integration
Amazon Transcribe makes it easy for developers to add speech to text capabilities (also known as ASR) to their applications. Audio data is virtually impossible for computers to search and analyze. Therefore, recorded speech needs to be converted to text before it can be used in applications. This PoC shows how can an audio file be converted to text using a simple Email workflow. A user can record an audio on their smart phone and send it to an email inbox as an attachment. Some back-end service monitoring that Inbox gets an "email-received" notification and sends the audio file to the Transcribe service for the transcription. Once the ASR process completes, the response text file is then emailed as an attachment to the sender.

## Tech Stack (Services/Frameworks)

- Amazon Transcribe
- Amazon WorkMail
- AWS Lambda (Python)
- AWS Lambda Layers (Java)
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon S3
- Amazon SES
- AWS SDK

## Setup

1. Install AWS CLI, Gradle (optionally Maven) and Java8
2. Clone the repo 
3. Create a user in WorkMail Organization and assign an email address like user@abc.awsapps.com
4. Go to DynamoDB Console and create a Table ("Transcribe") with MSG_ID (String) as the Partition Key
4. Create a Lambda function (from the code EmailProcessorLambda.py) with Python 3.8 Runtime
5. Modify DynamoRegion and TableName properties in the function accordingly 
6. Update Timeout setting of this function to 5 minutes
7. Assign S3, DynamoDB and WorkMail policies to the role used by this lambda function. Additionally, to access raw content of email body, add an inline policy like this:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "workmailmessageflow:GetRawMessageContent"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:workmailmessageflow:region_code:aws_account_id:message/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

8. Create a rule by going to WorkMail console -> Organization Settings -> Inbound Rules and setting Action to Run Lambda and specifying name of Lambda function created in earlier step and specify domain/email address for the filtering
10. Update Constants.java file accordingly 
11. Update ZIP file name (build/distributions/TranscribeEmailDemo.zip) in "Template.yml" and "build-layer.sh" files to match (most likely the project name)
12. Execute "create-bucket.sh". In case of "bucket already exists" error, change the bucket name in ALL create-bucket.sh, Constants.java and Python Lambda code (stored in a variable) - they should all be the same.
13. Execute "build-layer.sh"
14. Execute "deploy.sh"
15. Go to Lambda Console and add an S3 event trigger with following configurations:
    Bucket: "transcribe-email",
    Event Type: "All Object Create Events",
    Prefix: "audio/"
17. Go to SES console and validate email addresses that are going to be used for testing (this is a MUST if the SES account is a Sandbox account) 
18. Send an email to the WorkMail inbox with an audio file attachment (WAV/M4A/MP3/MP4) and in the response email - the sender will receive the transcribed file
